# Discordia

She was very wise in her time, new too much then she went dark from 2006... She might make a comeback at some stage, we have the technology - we can rebuild her.

## The bot

The cabal is an IRC room of past blackstar employees (mostly). It doesn't exist. This is the old bot that used to kick about the fabled room from about 2003-2006 - she doesn't really run anymore - she comes back into the room now and again to see what is happening and gives us old factoid information on each of us. More nostalgic than anything else now.
