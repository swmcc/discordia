1285256533 [460] <petemc/#cabal> changing the topic entirely, i watched 'the girl who kicked the hornets nest' last night
1285256536 [461] <beowulf/#cabal> it sucks
1285256540 [462] <beowulf/#cabal> any good?
1285256544 [463] <petemc/#cabal> not exactly faithful to the book
1285256555 [464] <petemc/#cabal> you read the books?
1285256558 [465] <beowulf/#cabal> i was reading about hornets recently

1285256604 [475] <swmcc/#cabal> i am reading the girl with the dragon tattoo on sunday mornings
1285256607 [476] <swmcc/#cabal> its not proving to be that bad
1285256609 [477] <beowulf/#cabal> and online articles
1285256616 [478] <petemc/#cabal> just as good :)
1285256623 [479] <petemc/#cabal> swmcc: aye, easy read, i enjoyed them
1285256671 [480] <petemc/#cabal> the third was my favourite, which apparently isnt the popular consensus
1285256685 [481] statement: <beowulf> would you assert that "at least one deity exists" is a false statement?

1285256703 [484] <petemc/#cabal> id ask for clarification on what a deity is
1285256716 [485] <beowulf/#cabal> interesting

1285256737 [487] statement: <petemc> "A deity[1] is a postulated preternatural or supernatural immortal being, who may be thought of as holy, divine, or sacred, held in high regard, and respected by believers, often religiously referred to as a god."

1285256741 [490] <petemc/#cabal> according to wikipedia
1285256767 [491] <beowulf/#cabal> so, true or false?
1285256781 [492] <petemc/#cabal> could nature also fit into that description?
1285256800 [493] <petemc/#cabal> hm, id say no
1285256815 [494] <petemc/#cabal> in which, your statement would in my opinion be false
1285256825 [495] <beowulf/#cabal> cool
1285256831 [496] <petemc/#cabal> im all about the random chance

1285745832 [605] <jaffs/#cabal> so I was glad to go fly tying last night
1285745877 [606] <jaffs/#cabal> left Rebecca with a new kitchen aid food processor to put together, she had been wanting one for ome time. She hadn't committed suicide with it when I got home, so that was a bonus

1285746163 [612] <jaffs/#cabal> 11 mth waiting list
1285746180 [613] <jaffs/#cabal> better on it than off it I guess

1286525380 [1918] <martymc/#cabal> wonders if beowulf got screwed by the trains this morning
1286525400 [1919] <martymc/#cabal> Cannon street had 'too many trains' on my way in this morning 
1286525422 [1920] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> there were 'too few' on the District Line they said
1286525432 [1921] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> passed through Cannon Street fine
1286525474 [1922] <martymc/#cabal> Where do you come into London?
1286525494 [1923] statement: <martymc> Cannon street mainline station that is ;)

1286525494 [1925] <martymc/#cabal> Cannon street mainline station that is ;)
1286525545 [1926] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> ah, right so. nah, in the morning's I go in to Liverpool Street, as the victoria Line is a nightmare at that time. So I avoid Tottenham Hale. I do it in the evening, mind
1286525697 [1927] <jaffs/#cabal> I got in my motor, drove along the M3, 15 mins later I'm at my desk
1286525902 [1928] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> the anonymous grey identikit box of a car?
1286526082 [1929] <martymc/#cabal> That means you get the circle line then?
1286526094 [1930] <martymc/#cabal> No wonder you're always moaning about the shitty trains
1286526146 [1931] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> sometimes I get the Met round to Aldgate East and take the district

1286526156 [1934] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> but usually the Circle is fine at that time
1286526173 [1935] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> when we move office I will have to get the Central, and this will kill me
1286526185 [1936] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> I intend t obe back in Cambridge before that happens
1286526209 [1937] <martymc/#cabal> Central
1286526217 [1938] <martymc/#cabal> Line seems ok anytime I take it
1286526232 [1939] <martymc/#cabal> But I guess it's busy from Liverpool street
1286526282 [1940] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> anytime I have had to use it, I have never been able to get on the first train
1286526289 [1941] <StrayTaoist/#cabal> regardless of what station I have been at

1288367553 [294] <StrayTao1st/#cabal> a mutator isn't the same as a um, changer
1288367595 [295] <StrayTao1st/#cabal> think of it more as a setter on steroids, I guess
1288367602 [296] <beowulf/#cabal> elaborate
1288367613 [297] <StrayTao1st/#cabal> so it does change, but can do computation on the current object as well
1288367623 [298] <StrayTao1st/#cabal> as opposed to just setting a value
1288367641 [299] <StrayTao1st/#cabal> so can change state

1288367673 [304] <StrayTao1st/#cabal> I hate CompSci types
1288367697 [305] <beowulf/#cabal> is that what it's trying to convey, that the change manifests itself in something other than just the object acted on?
1288367736 [306] <StrayTao1st/#cabal> no no, mutators act on an object
1288367770 [307] <beowulf/#cabal> ok, i get the intended meaning

1297952176 [119] <martymc/#cabal> plus we pissed off to NYC to get married
